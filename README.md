# COMP47360_DoubleDecker

Test coverage: 99%

## Welcome to Double Decker, Where to?
The  final  product  is  built  on  four  use  cases.  Number  one,  which  we  believe  is  the  essence  of  a bus  application  requirement. To  provide  a  route  from  A  to  B  with  an  estimate  of  the  journey time.  The user must input their origin and destination endpoints with optional time and date.  The route will display on the map along with the estimated journey time.

### Our Plan Page - Plan your routes.

### Our Tour Page - Tour your City. 
We thought we could bring spontaneity closer to our users by creating a day trip planner  with  random  points  of  interest  and  food  locations.   From  a  drop-down  menu,  you  can choose how many attractions or restaurants to visit and in what order.  A route from either your location or the city centre is described and shown on the map.  We take our users on a tour fro mone destination to another with minimal effort on their part.
